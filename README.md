## Structure

![structure](./src/components/assets/images/diagram.png)

- The create component is not done yet, but added searach and category components

## Notes

- At the first begining I tried to use material-UI, it ended up a bit hard to make all styles work as expected, and some sytax come with it dosen't work well, disturcturing for example, then I restarted with react-matarialize with create-react-app in order to make all new syntax work.

- At some point, I accidently git inited at src and the root folder, when I switch to root folder, there was a submodule warning, then I simply deleted the .git in src folder. I ended up not many commits.

- Refactored seach components to lift searchText and category state on refactor branch, but not working well


## Known Bugs

- The SearchResults components can not display at the right spot which is below the header
